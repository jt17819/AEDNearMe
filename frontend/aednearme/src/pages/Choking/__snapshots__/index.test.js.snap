          Step 1: If someone is choking, encourage them to cough.
        </h3>
        <p>
          If the blockage is severe, they may be holding their chest or neck and won't be able to speak, breathe or cough, and you will need to help them.
        </p>
        <h3
          class="makeStyles-text-12"
        >
          Step 2: Bend them forwards and give up to 5 back blows to try and dislodge the blockage.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Hit them firmly on their back with the heel of your hand between the shoulder blades.
        </p>
        <h3
          class="makeStyles-text-12"
        >
          Step 3: If they are still choking, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts: hold around the waist and pull inwards and upwards above their navel.
        </h3>

          Step 4: If they are still choking and become unresponsive, follow the procedure on how to give CPR.
